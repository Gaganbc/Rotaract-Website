                Rotaract is a global organization that brings together young adults aged 18 and above to take action in their communities, develop leadership and professional skills, and promote international understanding and peace. Sponsored by Rotary International, Rotaract clubs are either community-based or university-based and are part of Rotary's efforts to invest in the leaders of tomorrow.
